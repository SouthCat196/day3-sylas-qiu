**What did I learn**

    1. Why refactor and what are the benefits?
    2. When to refactor: Rule of Three, Bug Fixes, New Features, Code Review
    3. Some methods: Move, Extract, Inline, Rename, Organize, etc.
    4. How to refactor
    5. Using shortcuts can help us refactor more efficiently.
2. Concept Map: Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge.

**R:** Happy.

**I:**

- It was the first time I truly focused on refactoring, and I felt a strong sense of accomplishment seeing the demo transform from "bad code" to "good code."
- I learned many useful shortcuts during the refactoring process.
- My Standup Meeting reports still lack reflections on past improvements and future considerations; it seems I haven't been giving enough attention to these aspects.

---

**D:**

- In future Standup Meeting reports, I need to reduce the level of detail and provide a more layered approach to reporting.
- In future coding and refactoring tasks, I should force myself to use common shortcuts to help me avoid relying too much on the mouse and reduce cumbersome changes.
